# Meal-Recipe-App

Team: Liva Lova Java Flava

Maintaining a good meal balance is crucial to one's health and well-being. However, roadblocks are inevitable,
and our ability to prepare balanced meals vary from individual to individual, from day to day. Our team proposes
a solution to this struggle in the form of a recipe recommender app. Given the user's specified diet and other
restrictions/nutriment requirements, this program will generate a weekly plan for the user, providing information
about ingredients, nutritious value, and cooking instructions in the form of an url to the recipes. The user must create a profile
before they are able to start generating recipes; they will be prompted to enter their measurements and
list of preferences in a short survey.
